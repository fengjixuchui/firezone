description: Troubleshoot common connectivity and configuration issues with Firezone's WireGuard®-based secure access platform.
---

This guide documents common configuration and connectivity issues. For
any problems that arise, a good first bet is to check the Firezone logs.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

Each container stores logs as a JSON file on the host machine. These can be shown with the
`docker logs {CONTAINER}` command. Log files are found at
`var/lib/docker/containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/{CONTAINER_ID}-json.log` by default.

See [debug logs](../debug-logs) for additional details.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="omnibus" label="Omnibus">

Firezone logs are stored in `/var/log/firezone` and can be viewed with
`sudo firezone-ctl tail`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Application crash loop preventing config changes

In cases where the application is crash looping because of corrupt, inaccessible, or
invalid data in the DB, you can try clearing the affected fields.

For example, to clear OIDC configs:

```text
psql -d firezone -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "UPDATE configurations SET openid_connect_providers = '{}'"
```

Similarly, to clear SAML configs:

```text
psql -d firezone -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "UPDATE configurations SET saml_providers = '{}'"
```

## Debugging portal WebSocket connectivity issues

The portal UI requires a secure websocket connection to function. To facilitate
this, the Firezone phoenix service checks the `Host` header for inbound
websocket connections and only permits the connection if it matches the host
portion of your `default['firezone']['external_url']` variable.

If a secure websocket connection can't be established, you'll see a red dot
indicator in the upper-right portion of the Firezone web UI and a corresponding
message when you hover over it:

```text
Secure websocket not connected! ...
```

If you're accessing Firezone using the same URL defined in your
`default['firezone']['external_url']` variable from above, the issue is likely
to be in your reverse proxy configuration.

In most cases, you'll find clues in one or more of the following locations:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="omnibus" label="Omnibus">

* Your browser's developer tool logs, specifically the `Network` tab.
* `sudo firezone-ctl tail nginx`
* `sudo firezone-ctl tail phoenix`

If the websocket connection is successful, you should see output in the
`phoenix` service logs similar the following:

## Debugging WireGuard connectivity issues

Most connectivity issues with Firezone are caused by other `iptables` or
`nftables` rules which interfere with Firezone's operation. If you have rules
active, you'll need to ensure these don't conflict with the Firezone rules.

### Internet connectivity drops when tunnel is active

If your Internet connectivity drops whenever you activate your WireGuard
tunnel, you should make sure that the `FORWARD` chain allows packets
from your WireGuard clients to the destinations you want to allow through
Firezone.

If you're using `ufw`, this can be done by making sure the default routing
policy is `allow`:

```text
ubuntu@fz:~$ sudo ufw default allow routed
Default routed policy changed to 'allow'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly)
```

A `ufw` status for a typical Firezone server might look like this:

```text
ubuntu@fz:~$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), allow (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
80/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
443/tcp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
51820/udp                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
51820/udp (v6)             ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

## Admin login isn't working

If the password for the account with email `ADMIN_EMAIL` isn't working, you can reset it using the process below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

First change directory to your Firezone root, then run the `bin/create-or-reset-admin` script
to reset the admin user's password. The password for the user specified by
`ADMIN_EMAIL`
in `$HOME/.firezone/.env` will be reset to the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable.

```shell
  cd $HOME/.firezone
  docker compose exec firezone bin/create-or-reset-admin
```

**Note**: If local authentication is disabled, resetting the admin user's
password will not re-enable it.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="omnibus" label="Omnibus">

Run the following command to reset the password on the default admin user.

```shell
sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Re-enable local authentication in CLI

For production deployments, we recommend adding a TOTP-based second factor to
admin accounts. If you promoted an account authenticated through an identity
provider, you can consider disabling local authentication for additional
security.

If issues arise with your identity provider integration, it's possible you
could be locked out of the admin portal. To re-enable local authentication so
you can log in and resolve the issue, run the following query on the host of
your Firezone instance:

```shell
cd $HOME/.firezone
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 -d firezone -c "UPDATE configurations SET local_auth_enabled = 't'"
```
