# Add or remove devices

When a device is created, Firezone generates the WireGuard private key
ephemerally in the user's browser. This key is **never saved**, and cannot
be shown again once it is no longer displayed.

**We recommend asking end users to generate their own device configs so the
WireGuard private key is not exposed.** Users can follow instructions
on the [Client Instructions](/user-guides/client-instructions/) page to
generate their own WireGuard configs.

## Admin Device Config Generation

Firezone admins can generate device configs for all users. This can be done by
clicking the "Add Device" button on the user profile page found in `/users`.

Once the device profile is created, the admin can download and send the
WireGuard configuration file to the user over a secure channel.

See [Add Users](/user-guides/add-users/) for more information on how to add a
user.
