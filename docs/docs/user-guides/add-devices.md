**We recommend asking users to generate their own device configs so the private
key is exposed only to them.** Users can follow instructions on the
[Client Instructions](../user-guides/client-instructions)
page to generate their own device configs.

## Admin device config generation

Firezone admins can generate device configs for all users. This can be done by
clicking the "Add Device" button on the user profile page found in `/users`.

Once the device profile is created, you can send the WireGuard configuration
file to the user.

Devices are associated with users. See [Add Users](../user-guides/add-users) for
more information on how to add a user.
