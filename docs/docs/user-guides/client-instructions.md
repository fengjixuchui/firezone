## Install and Setup

Follow this guide to establish a VPN session
through the WireGuard native client.

### Step 1 - Install the native WireGuard client

Firezone is compatible with the official WireGuard clients found here:

* [MacOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025)
* [Windows](https://download.wireguard.com/windows-client/wireguard-installer.exe)
* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android)

For operating systems not listed above see the Official WireGuard site: [
https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

### Step 2 - Download the device config file

The device config file can either be obtained from your Firezone administrator
or self-generated via the Firezone portal.

To self generate a device config file, visit the domain provided by your Firezone
administrator. This URL will be specific to your company
(in this example it is `https://firezone.example.com`)

### Step 3 - Add the config to the client

Open the WireGuard client and import the `.conf` file.
Activate the VPN session by toggling the `Activate` switch.

## Re-authenticating your session

If your network admin has required periodic authentication to maintain your VPN session,
follow the steps below. You will need:

* **URL of the Firezone portal**: Ask your Network Admin for the link.
* **Credentials**: Your username and password should be provided by your Network
Admin. If your company is using a Single Sign On provider (like Google or Okta),
the Firezone portal will prompt you to authenticate via that provider.

### Step 1 - Deactivate VPN session

### Step 2 - Re-authenticate

Visit the URL of your Firezone portal and sign in using credentials provided by your
network admin. If you are already logged into the portal,
click the `Reauthenticate` button, then sign in again.

### Step 3 - Activate VPN session

## Linux - Network Manager

The following steps can be used on Linux devices to import the WireGuard
configuration profile using Network Manager CLI (`nmcli`).

Note: Importing the configuration file using the Network Manager GUI may fail
with the following error if the profile has IPv6 support enabled:

```text
ipv6.method: method "auto" is not supported for WireGuard
```

### Step 1 - Install the WireGuard Tools

The WireGuard userspace tools need to be installed. For most Linux
distributions this will be a package named `wireguard` or `wireguard-tools`.

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install wireguard
```

For Fedora:

```shell
sudo dnf install wireguard-tools
```

For Arch Linux:

```shell
sudo pacman -S wireguard-tools
```

For distributions not listed above see the Official WireGuard site: [
https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

### Step 2 - Download configuration

The device config file can either be obtained from your Firezone administrator
or self-generated via the Firezone portal.

To self generate a device config file, visit the domain provided by your Firezone
administrator. This URL will be specific to your company
(in this example it is `https://firezone.example.com`)

### Step 3 - Import configuration

Using `nmcli`, import the downloaded configuration file:

```shell
sudo nmcli connection import type wireguard file /path/to/configuration.conf
```

Note: The WireGuard connection/interface will match the name of the configuration
file. If required, the connection can be renamed after import:

```shell
nmcli connection modify [old name] connection.id [new name]
```

### Step 4 - Connect/disconnect

To connect to the VPN via the command line:

```shell
nmcli connection up [vpn name]
```

To disconnect:

```shell
nmcli connection down [vpn name]
```

If using a GUI, the relevant Network Manager applet can also be used to control
the connection.

### Auto Connection

The VPN connection can be set to automatically connect by setting the `autoconnect`
option to `yes`:

```shell
nmcli connection modify [vpn name] connection.autoconnect yes
```

To disable the automatic connection set it back to `no`:

```shell
nmcli connection modify [vpn name] connection.autoconnect no
```
