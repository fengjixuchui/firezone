# Restrict application authentication to VPN users

Some identity providers support restricting SSO functionality
Some identity providers support restricting SSO access to a predefined CIDR range or list of IP addresses. You can set this to the IP address of
your Firezone gateway to restrict SSO to users connected to Firezone.

This adds an additional layer of security to any service that uses
your identity provider for SSO.

We have identified a few common providers that support this
feature and included basic instructions below on how you can set
this up. The pre-requisites to this guide are a deployed Firezone
server with a static IP
([see NAT Gateway](.../nat-gateway))
and ensuring traffic to the identity provider's SSO services are
routed from client devices through the Firezone gateway
([see Split Tunnel](.../split-tunnel)).

## Okta

Okta supports restricting SSO authentication to a "network zone" on
a per application basis.

:::note
If you have split tunneling enabled, ensure the AllowedIPs are
correctly configured to direct traffic to
[Okta's IPs](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/ip-address-allow-listing.htm)
through the Firezone gateway.
:::

:::caution
Sign-on policies are assigned on an application level. We advise
excluding the Firezone application from the IP restriction policy above if Okta
is being used for Firezone authentication.

With
[periodic authentication](../../authenticate#enforce-periodic-re-authentication)
enabled, you may be locked out of Okta entirely when your VPN session
expires.

### Create the network zone

_This section is based on Okta's
[documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/network/create-ip-zone.htm)._

Navigate to **Security > Networks**. Add an **IP Zone** with the
static IP of the Firezone Gateway in **Gateway IPs**.

![network zone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/193468881-d8945fb3-8a7e-45fc-88e2-9856473894b5.png)

### Create a sign-on policy

_This section is based on Okta's
[documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/network/add-network-zone-signon-policy.htm)._

Navigate to **Security > Authentication policies**. Create a new
policy that denies access when a user
is **NOT** on the network zone defined above.

![sign on policy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/193468882-800e9baf-757f-485f-bb39-a1492a11f612.png)

### Associate sign-on policy to application

Under the **Sign On** tab, set the **Authentication policy** to the
policy defined above. Do this for applications where authentication
should be restricted only to users on the VPN.

![associate policy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/193468877-f49412e1-3961-497d-9b8c-f5d003f9857d.png)

### Configure VPN notification (optional)

_This section is based on Okta's
[documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/network/vpn-notification.htm)._

Optionally configure a notification to alert users why
their access was denied.
On the details page of your Okta application, configure the
**General > VPN Notification** section.
