This guide will walk through using Firezone as a relay to connect
two devices. A typical use case for this configuration is to enable an
administrator to access a server, container, or machine that is normally
behind a NAT or firewall.

## General Case - Node to Node

This example demonstrates a simple scenario where a tunnel is established
between Device A and Device B.

Start by creating Device A and Device B by navigating to `/users/[user_id]/new_device`.
In the settings for each device, ensure the following parameters are set to the
values listed below. You can set device settings when creating the device config
(see [Add Devices](/user-guides/add-devices/)).
If you need to update settings on an existing device, you can do so by generating
a new device config.

Note `PersistentKeepalive` can also be set in on the
`/settings/defaults` page for all devices.

Device A

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device B
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the device is behind a NAT, this ensures the
  device is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from
  the WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may
  need to decrease this value depending on your environment.

Device B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

## Admin Case - One to Many Nodes

This example demonstrates a scenario where Device A can communicate
bi-directionally with Devices B through D. This configuration could represent an
administrator or engineer accessing multiple resources
(servers, containers, or machines) in different networks.

In the settings for each device, ensure the following parameters are set to the
values listed below. You can set device settings when creating the device config
(see [Add Devices](/user-guides/add-devices/)).
If you need to update settings on an existing device, you can do so by generating
a new device config.

Device A (Administrator Node)

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32, 10.3.2.4/32, 10.3.2.5/32`: This is the IP of
  devices B through D. Optionally you could set a range of IPs as long as it
  includes the IPs of Devices B through D.
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the device is behind a NAT, this ensures the
  device is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from
  the WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may
  need to decrease this value depending on your environment.

Device B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Device C

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Device D

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`
