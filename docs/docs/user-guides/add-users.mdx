Once you have successfully installed Firezone you'll need to add users to grant
them access to your network. This is done through the Web UI.

## Web UI

Add a user by clicking the "Add User" button under `/users`. You will be asked
to specify an email and a password for the user. Firezone can also integrate and
sync with an identity provider to automatically grant access to users in your
organization. See [Authenticate](/authenticate/) for more
information.
