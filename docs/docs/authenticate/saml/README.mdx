Firezone supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0.

## Provider Support

In general, most identity providers that support SAML 2.0 should work with
Firezone.

| Provider               | Support Status           | Notes                              |
| ---                    | ---                      | ---                                |
| [Okta](okta)           | **Tested and supported** |                                    |
| [Onelogin](onelogin)   | **Tested and supported** |                                    |
| [Jumpcloud](jumpcloud) | **Tested and supported** | Uncheck `Require signed envelopes` |

Occasionally, providers that don't implement the full SAML 2.0 standard or use
uncommon configurations may be problematic. If this is the case, [contact us](
https://www.firezone.dev/contact/sales) about a custom integration.

## Prerequisites

Before using SAML 2.0 in Firezone, you'll first need to generate a set of
private and public keys using the RSA or DSA algorithms along with an X.509
certificate that contains the public key. This can be generated with `openssl`
using the following one-liner:

```text
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout saml.key -out saml.crt
```

Now, configure your Firezone portal to use these:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

Set the `SAML_KEY_PATH` and `SAML_CERT_PATH` environment variables to
the path containing your `saml.key` and `saml.crt` above. If using our [example
docker compose file](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/master/docker-compose.prod.yml),
which includes a volume for mapping configuration,
save these files to `$HOME/.firezone/firezone` on the Docker host and set the
`SAML_KEY_PATH=/var/firezone/saml.key` and
`SAML_CERT_PATH=/var/firezone/saml.crt` environment variables for the Firezone
container.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="omnibus" label="Omnibus">

Set the following attributes in your `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb`
configuration file:

```ruby
default['firezone']['authentication']['saml']['key'] = '/path/to/your/saml.key'
default['firezone']['authentication']['saml']['cert'] = '/path/to/your/saml.crt'
```

and run `firezone-ctl reconfigure` to pick up the changes.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## General Instructions

Once you've configured Firezone with an X.509 certificate and corresponding
private key as shown above, you'll need a few more things to set up a generic
SAML integration.

Use these general instructions to configure a SAML connector for a provider not listed
above.

### IdP Metadata Document

You'll need to get the SAML Metadata XML document from your identity provider. In most
cases this can be downloaded from your IdP's SAML App configuration dashboard.

### ACS URL

Firezone constructs the ACS URL based on the Base URL and Configuration ID entered
in the Firezone SAML configuration, defaulting to: `EXTERNAL_URL/auth/saml/sp/consume/:config_id`,
e.g. `https://firezone.company.com/auth/saml/sp/consume/okta`.

### Entity ID

The Firezone Entity ID can be configured with the `SAML_ENTITY_ID` environment variable
and defaults to `urn:firezone.dev:firezone-app` if not set.

See the [environment variable reference](/reference/env-vars) for more information.
