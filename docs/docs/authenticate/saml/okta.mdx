Firezone supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using Okta through the generic SAML 2.0 connector. This guide will walk you through how to configure the integration.

## Create a SAML connector

In the Okta admin portal, create a new app integration under
the Application tab. Select `SAML 2.0` as the authentication method.
Use the following config values during setup:

| Setting                        | Value                                                                                                                 |
|---                             |---                                                                                                                    |
| App name                       | `Firezone`                                                                                                            |
| App logo                       | [save link as](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/155907625-a4f6c8c2-3952-488d-b244-3c37400846cf.png) |
| Single sign on URL             | `https://firezone.company.com/auth/saml/sp/consume/okta`                                                              |
| Audience (EntityID)            | `urn:firezone.dev:firezone-app`                                                                                       |
| Name ID format                 | `EmailAddress`                                                                                                        |
| Application username           | `Email`                                                                                                               |
| Update application username on | `Create and update`                                                                                                   |

[Okta's documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SAML.htm)
contains additional details on the purpose of each configuration setting. In all
the fields above, replace `firezone.company.com` with your deployment's external URL.

## Add SAML identity provider to Firezone

In the Firezone portal, add a SAML identity provider under the Security tab
by filling out the following information:

| Setting   | Value      | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
|---        |---         |---                                                                                                                                    |
| Config ID | `Okta`     | Firezone uses this value to construct endpoints required in the SAML authentication flow (e.g., receiving assertions, login requests).|
| Label     | `Okta`     | Appears on the sign in button for authentication.                                                                                     |
| Metadata  | see note   | Upload the contents of the SAML metadata document you downloaded in the previous step from Okta.                                      |

After saving the SAML config, you should see a `Sign in with Okta` button
on your Firezone portal sign-in page.
