Firezone supports the following authentication methods:

1. [Local email/password (default)](local-auth)
1. [SSO authentication via OpenID Connect](oidc)
1. [SSO authentication via SAML 2.0](saml)

:::note
If your Identity Provider doesn't work with the methods listed above,
[contact us](https://www.firezone.dev/contact/sales) about custom integrations.

## Integrate an SSO Provider

We've included instructions on how to set up Firezone with several popular
identity providers using our Generic OIDC integration:

* [Okta](oidc/okta)
* [Azure Active Directory](oidc/azuread)
* [Google](oidc/google)
* [Onelogin](oidc/onelogin)
* [JumpCloud](saml/jumpcloud)
* [Keycloak](oidc/keycloak)
* [Zitadel](oidc/zitadel)
* [Auth0](oidc/auth0)

If your identity provider is not listed above, but has a generic OIDC or SAML
connector, please consult their documentation to find instructions on obtaining
the configuration settings required. Instructions for setting up Firezone with any
generic OIDC provider can be found [here](oidc).

Open a [Github issue](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues)
to request documentation or submit a pull request to add documentation for your
provider.

### The OIDC Redirect URL

For each OIDC provider a corresponding URL is created for redirecting to
the configured provider's sign-in URL. The URL format is `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/PROVIDER`
where `PROVIDER` is the OIDC key for that particular provider.

For example, the OIDC config below

```json
{
  "google": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "...": "..."
  },
  "okta": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

would generate the following URLs:

* `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/google`
* `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/okta`

These URLs could then be distributed to end users for direct navigation to
the identity provider's login portal for authentication to Firezone.

## Enforce Periodic Re-authentication

Periodic re-authentication can be enforced by changing the setting in
`settings/security`. This can be used to ensure a user must sign in to Firezone
periodically in order to maintain their VPN session.

You can set the session length to a minimum of **1 hour** and maximum of **90 days**.
Setting this to Never disables this setting, allowing VPN sessions indefinitely.
This is the default.

### Re-authentication

To re-authenticate an expired VPN session, a user will need to turn off their
VPN session and sign in to the Firezone portal (URL specified during
[deployment](../deploy#prepare-to-deploy)).

See detailed Client Instructions on how to re-authenticate your session
[here](../user-guides/client-instructions).

#### VPN Connection Status

A user's connection status is shown on the Users page under the table column
`VPN Connection`. The connection statuses are:

* ENABLED - The connection is enabled.
* DISABLED - The connection is disabled by an administrator or OIDC refresh failure.
* EXPIRED - The connection is disabled due to authentication expiration or a user
has not signed in for the first time.
