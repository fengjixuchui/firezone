:::

Firezone maintains two types of logs tied to user identity: configuration logs
and network activity logs.

Configuration logs track events related to the configuration of Firezone
itself, either by admins or users. Network activity logs track connections to
protected resources made by users of your network.

Logged events are recorded as JSON objects and stored in the database. These
are accessible via a REST API or the Firezone portal, and exportable to CSV
format.
