# Configure Firezone

There are two types of configuration in Firezone:

* [Runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration): Application configuration
  related to day-to-day operation of Firezone.
* [Deployment configuration](#deployment-configuration): Deployment or
  infrastructure-related configuration relevant to running Firezone on-prem.

## Runtime Configuration

Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can be done via the Web UI.
This type of configuration can be expected to be changed **with no downtime**
in a production deployment.

We're actively working to move more configuration variables to
this type of configuration, so expect more ENV vars to transition to runtime
configuration in the future.

## Deployment Configuration

Deployment-related and infrastructure configuration require restarting Firezone
services after change.

Docker-based deployments are configured through environment
variables passed to the `firezone` container. These can be
specified either in a `.env` file in the current directory,
the `docker-compose.yml` file, or passed to the `docker run`
call directly. See the [env var reference](../../reference/env-vars)
for a complete listing.

See [Docker's documentation
](https://docs.docker.com/compose/envvars-precedence/) for more information.

<TabItem value="omnibus" label="Omnibus">

For Omnibus-based deployments, Firezone leverages [Chef Omnibus
](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) to handle release packaging, process
supervision, log management, and more.

The main configuration file is written in [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and can
be found at `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb` on a default installation.
Changing this file **requires re-running** `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`
which triggers Chef to pick up the changes and apply them to the running
system.

For an exhaustive list of Omnibus configuration variables and their
descriptions, see the [configuration file reference
](../../reference/configuration-file).
