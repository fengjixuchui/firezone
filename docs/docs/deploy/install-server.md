[prerequisites](../deploy/prerequisites) before following this
guide.

## Installation Instructions

Assuming you're running a supported Linux kernel on one of the [supported
platforms](./supported-platforms), use one of the methods below to get started:

### Automatic Install

The easiest way to get started using Firezone is via the automatic installation
script:

```bash
sudo -E bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/firezone/firezone/raw/master/scripts/install.sh)"
```

This will ask you a few questions regarding your install, install the latest
release for your platform, then create an administrator user and print to the
console instructions for logging in to the web UI.

### Install from our Debian or RedHat repositories

If the automatic install script fails, try these steps to install Firezone from our
[Cloudsmith repository](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone).

1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for your distro.
   If using Linux kernel 5.6 or higher, skip this step.

1. Install our package repository for your distro's package format:
    - deb packages:

        ```bash
        curl -1sLf \
          'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/firezone/firezone/setup.deb.sh' \
          | sudo -E bash
        ```

    See the [Debian setup docs](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone/setup/#formats-deb)
    for more options if the script fails to setup the repo.

    - rpm packages:

        ```bash
        curl -1sLf \
          'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/firezone/firezone/setup.rpm.sh' \
          | sudo -E bash
        ```

    See the [RedHat setup docs](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone/setup/#formats-rpm)
    for more options if the script fails to setup the repo.

1. Install Firezone with your distro's package manager:

    ```bash
    # Using apt
    sudo apt install firezone

    # Using dnf
    sudo dnf install firezone

    # Using yum
    sudo yum install firezone

    # Using zypper
    sudo zypper install firezone
    ```

1. Follow the [bootstrap instructions](#bootstrap-firezone) to setup Firezone.

### Manual Install

If all else fails, try these steps to install Firezone manually.

1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for your distro.
   If using Linux kernel 5.6 or higher, skip this step.
1. Download the relevant package for your distribution from the [releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
1. Install with `sudo rpm -i firezone*.rpm` or `sudo dpkg -i firezone*.deb`
   depending on your distro.
1. Follow the [bootstrap instructions](#bootstrap-firezone) to setup Firezone.

### Bootstrap Firezone

1. Bootstrap the application with `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`. This will
   initialize config files, set up needed services and generate the default
   configuration.
1. Edit the default configuration located at `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb`.
   We've chosen sensible defaults that should be a good starting point for most
   installations. For production installations, you'll want to specify a valid
   external URL and enable ACME for certificate issuance and renewal:

   ```ruby
   # Auto-generated based on the server's hostname.
   # Set this to the URL used to access the Firezone Web UI.
   default['firezone']['external_url'] = 'https://firezone.example.com'

   # Set the email that will be used for the issued certificates and certifications.
   default['firezone']['ssl']['email_address'] = 'your@email.com'

   # Enable ACME renewal
   default['firezone']['ssl']['acme']['enabled'] = true
   ```

   See the complete [configuration file reference for more details](../reference/configuration-file).

1. Reconfigure the application to pick up the new changes:
   `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`.
1. Finally, create an admin user with `sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin`.
   The login credentials will be printed to the console output.
1. Now you should be able to sign in to the web UI at the URL you specified in
   step 5 above, e.g. `https://firezone.example.com`
