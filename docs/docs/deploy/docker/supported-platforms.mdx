Firezone currently supports the following platforms for Docker-based
deployments.

| OS      | Architecture(s) | Runtime        | Status          | Notes                                            |
| ---     | ---             | ---            | ---             | ---                                              |
| Linux   | `amd64` `arm64` | Docker Server  | Fully-supported | `wireguard` module needed for kernels &lt; `5.6` |
| Linux   | `amd64` `arm64` | Docker Desktop | Fully-supported | Not recommended for production deployments.      |
| macOS   | `amd64` `arm64` | Docker Desktop | Fully-supported | Not recommended for production deployments.      |
| Windows | `amd64` `arm64` | Docker Desktop | Fully-supported | Not recommended for production deployments.      |

:::info
Docker Desktop [rewrites the source address
](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-docker-desktop-networking-works-under-the-hood/)
for packets flowing out of container networks under some conditions. This can
cause routing loops and other hard to debug connectivity issues with Firezone.
We recommend **only** using Docker Server for Linux for production deployments.
